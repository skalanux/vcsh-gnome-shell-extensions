# Switcher

Switcher is a [Gnome Shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org) for quickly
switching windows by typing.

### Installation

Download from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/973/switcher/ or
checkout to the correct place as

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions # only needed if this is the first extension you install
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
git clone https://github.com/daniellandau/switcher.git switcher@landau.fi
```

You can then enable the extension with Gnome Tweak Tool.

### How to use

Use the configured hot key (<Super>w by default) to open the switcher and start
typing a part of the name or current title of the window you want. Hit the Esc
key to cancel and the Return key to activate the window at the top of the list.

## Aknowledgements

As there is no really good central place to find documentation on writing Gnome
Shell Extensions I'll list here where I got information from.

* The source code of [Project Hamster Extension](https://github.com/projecthamster/shell-extension)
* The source code of [Window List Extension](http://git.gnome.org/gnome-shell-extensions)
* The source code of [Todo.txt Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/570/todotxt/)
* The source code of [Gnome Shell itself](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/) (especially the file js/ui/switcherPopup.js)
* The documentation listed in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13107743/documentation-for-writing-gnome-shell-extensions)
* The [Shell Toolkit documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/st/stable/),
  which is written for the C library, but can be used for JS too, using e.g.
  `new St.Label()` to make a an StLabel.
